### LEDs & Sound for Warhammer

Just a fun project to add sound and lights to my Warhammer tanks. ESP32 + DFPlayer Mini + LEDs.

## What I Did

- MP3 sounds (engine, guns, etc.) from SD card
- Neopixel LEDs for glowy bits
- ESP32 does the brains, DFPlayer does the noise
- I just use buttons for triggers, but you could do more

## Parts I Used

- Seeed Studio Xaio ESP32-C3 dev board
- DFPlayer Mini
- microSD card (with MP3s)
- LEDs
- Speaker (8Î©)

## Wiring

ESP32 TX -> DFPlayer RX
ESP32 RX -> DFPlayer TX
GNDs together
5V to DFPlayer
Speaker to DFPlayer
